      "  The pipes you'll create to transport the many liquids and gasses can only contain a single type of fluid at a time and they wont connect directly to empty pipes or containers and machines automatically, so make sure to use that wrench to configure them properly.",
      "<br/>",
      "  You can forcefully initiate a connection by right-clicking the center of the pipe with your wrench, or by right-clicking a block with a pipe in your hand; thought it won't consume the pipe, just connect it.",

      "  Every tick, the fluid pipe will attempt to evenly extract from all connected blocks and then attempt to insert that into all other connected blocks. ",

      "  Here's a few other tips you might enjoy, use them wisely and abuse them to your complete advantage: You can have up to 3 pipes in a single block for ultimate compact-ness! Luckily, pipes of different color will --never-- connect. Finally, right-clicking a pipe with a wrench will change the connection type and shift-right-clicking will drop the pipe.",
