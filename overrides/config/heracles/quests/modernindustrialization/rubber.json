      "  Flexible, non-conductive, and strong. Rubber will be a major part of every electric machine. You can produce it by mixing paper with either /b/Synthetic Oil/b/ or /b/Synthetic Rubber/b/. Mix the coke dust you made with water in a mixer to produce /b/Raw Synthetic Oil/b/. Use a steam blast furnace to produce these two fluids. /b/Synthetic Rubber/b/ is more difficult to obtain, but will yield more rubber per sheet of paper.",
