      "  I've got the perfect tool for you, it'll just take a bit of time to craft. It's a /b/Steam Mining Drill/b/! These can mine in a much larger space than regular ol' pickaxes can; 3x3 to be exact. Not only will you be able to mine more efficiently, but you'll be able to make beautiful tunnels with ease.",
      "<br/>",
      "  Want to know something cool? This drill --silk touches-- blocks as well! I know right? It's awesome! This way you'll get --way-- more bang for your buck when you pair it with the Forge Hammer since you can crush full ores instead of starting from raw ores.",
      "<br/>",
      "  One small... would you call it a downside? You need to power it. For some reason, the drill itself never actually breaks, but you'll need to feed it water and some type of burnable fuel; for example coal or lignite. Just right click the fuel items into your drill within your inventory to fill it up!",
      "<br/>",
      "  A tip for you: Carry around a water bucket. Not only will this allow you to negate fall damage if you're skilled enough, but also as a source of water to run your drill off of. For some reason, depending on the use case, this world's water sources are infinite; use this to your advantage.",
      "<br/>",
      "  A --second-- tip: Crouch to mine single blocks if you need! They'll still be in the silktouch form, but it wont do the 3x3, incase you need to mine blocks more delicately.",
