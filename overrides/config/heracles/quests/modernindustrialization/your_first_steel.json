      "  Darker and cooler than iron... Plus about 1000 times stronger. It's time to make some steel! Use that coal coke you produced earlier and crush it down to a pile of dust. Then, combine that with iron dust to get your /b/Uncooked Steel Dust/b/. Remember, using the mixer will increase your output.",
      "<br/>",
      "  Now, remember the finest steel has to go through the hottest fire; so we'll be using the steam blast furnace to reach the extreme temperatures required to melt down the powdered mixture and fuse them together.",
      "<br/>",
      "  Now that you have obtained steel, you can upgrade your bronze machines with /b/Steel Machine Upgrades/b/. Steel machines can process recipes up to 4 EU/t and will process recipes at twice the speed than normal as long as the energy usage doesn't go above 4 EU/t. With this higher roof of energy usage, you might be able to make new things now.",
